# 32-Bit-Low-Power-ALU-using-CRC-for-Error-Detection
In this work, we have developed a 32-bit low power ALU on Xilinx Vivado 2024.2, and also incorporated error detection capabilities using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Our model incorporates the Peres and Fredkin gates, as well as clock gating, for low power applications, and is able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
